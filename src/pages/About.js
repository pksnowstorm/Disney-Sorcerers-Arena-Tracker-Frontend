        <p>Hello, my name is Eric Nguyen, better known as Knight369 and Cassim in the game. 
            I created this website as I got tired of looking through the game and multiple 
            different discord servers trying to search for information. 
            This website combines all the information from multiple discord servers into one convenient place.
